# A-kart

**Business Context**

A-Kart, a renowned e-commerce platform, offers a diverse range of products. To drive revenue growth in the upcoming fiscal year, the Sales and Marketing department has set an objective: 
enhancing revenues by targeting existing customers through precision marketing. The ultimate decision regarding this strategy rests with the Vice President of Sales

**GAP Analysis**

In the current year, the company has met its projected targets successfully. Nonetheless, the company's recent focus has predominantly been on acquiring new customers, an endeavor known for its costliness. 
In the forthcoming year, budget constraints demand a more resourceful approach. Notably, the company has not harnessed any marketing efforts for its existing customer base thus far. 

**Vision**

The Sales and Marketing department will be provided with dashboards that refresh every 15 days. These dashboards will focus on identifying the top percentage of customers responsible for contributing 50% or more of the total revenue.

A customer segmentation approach using RFM scores will be implemented, classifying customers into the following categories: VIP, Active, Dormant, and Lost customers.
A Customer LTV will be calculated for each customer.
